# narrative-recommend

This is an attempt to combine Andyreagan's work, "The emotional arcs of stories are dominated by six basic shapes", with a reccomendation system.
Andy's use of a hedonometer to create sentiment maps over the plot of a book in order to create narrative arcs present powerful data for interpreting stories.  What if we try collecting maps of stories and using them in a reccomendation system?
